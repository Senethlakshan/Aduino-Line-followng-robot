Robotic Application Development - Automated Robot Car ðŸ¤–ðŸ‘»

This project is a linear follower robot using Arduino. The robot uses two infrared proximity sensors to detect the line and based on the input from the sensors, the Arduino directs the motors to move with the help of a motor shield.

The linear follower robot is autonomous, which means that it automatically follows a pre-defined line. Generally, it follows a black line on a white surface or a white line on a black surface. 
Some of the basic functions of a linear follower are given below: âˆ™ The IR sensor array installed on the front-bottom side of the robot reads the pre-defined line and sends those readings to the Arduino. 
The ATMega microcontroller built on the Arduino analyzes those readings and performs specific operations. âˆ™ The steering mechanism of this robot is simple. Four wheels are used, with two wheels on the back connected to the motors and two 
wheels on the front of the robot. âˆ™ In a straight line, the speed is faster and in a turn, the speed is relatively slower depending on the angle of the turn. Good motor quality and good sensory quality increase robot locomotion performance.

There are 02 models of this robot.

01.Bluetooth mod: where the robot is controlled by a smart phone
02. Line following mode: Automatically follow navigate in the track

Here the robot will stop and generate a continuous beep when there is an obstacle in the operating path.
